# ARK - Overhead Controller of Sheffield Robotics

Here we provide the Eagle files (schematics, layouts and gerbers) for the implementation of the new Overhead Controller (OHC) for the Kilobots. 

The bootloader for the microcontroller is the same as the Arduino Pro Mini and can be found here: https://github.com/arduino/Arduino/tree/master/hardware/arduino/avr/bootloaders/atmega 

The software for the microcontroller can be found here: https://github.com/acornejo/kilolib
